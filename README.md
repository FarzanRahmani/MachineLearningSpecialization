# Machine Learning Specialization

## Overview

This repository contains my work from the **Machine Learning Specialization**, which covers a wide range of machine learning concepts and techniques. This specialization consists of three courses:

1. **Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification**
   - Topics: Linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, decision trees, and more.
   - Focus: Understanding the foundations of supervised learning, developing predictive models, and applying them to real-world tasks.
   
2. **Advanced Learning Algorithms**
   - Topics: Regularization, neural networks (deep learning), ensemble methods, and other advanced techniques.
   - Focus: Building on foundational knowledge with advanced methods for improving model performance and generalization.
   
3. **Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning**
   - Topics: Clustering, anomaly detection, recommender systems, and reinforcement learning.
   - Focus: Understanding how to work with unlabeled data and implement algorithms that learn through interaction with environments.

## Skills Acquired

- **Supervised Learning**: Applied linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks to solve both regression and classification problems.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Implemented clustering techniques (K-means, Gaussian Mixture Models), performed anomaly detection, and built recommender systems.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Explored policy and value-based learning to enable models to make decisions in uncertain environments.
- **Advanced Techniques**: Gained expertise in regularization, deep learning, and ensemble methods like boosting and bagging.
  
## Certificate

I successfully completed this specialization and received a certificate acknowledging my proficiency in these machine learning topics. You can view it [here](https://coursera.org/verify/specialization/FVTLKQ8KMUAE).

## Projects

Throughout the specialization, I applied machine learning techniques to various projects, including:

- Predicting housing prices using regression models
- Classifying emails as spam or non-spam with logistic regression and decision trees
- Recommender system for a movie platform
- Implementing reinforcement learning agents to solve games or optimization problems

## How to Use This Repository

Each course has its own folder containing:
- Lecture notes
- Jupyter notebooks with exercises and projects
- Implementations of algorithms covered in the course

Feel free to explore the code, use it for learning, and adapt it for your own projects.
